# Cobalt — Manual Verification (UAT) Checklist

## 1. Purpose & how to use

Cobalt's automated suite (unit tests + PTY smokes) runs entirely against faked
HTTP — the app has never been exercised against a real Azure DevOps
organization. This document is the human validation pass: work through it top
to bottom against your real ADO org, ticking each item. For every item, mark
the **Result** line `Pass` or `Fail` and add notes. On any failure, capture
(a) the exact on-screen text (the bottom message bar and/or stderr), (b) the
`:messages` log (open the palette with `:`, type `messages`, Enter — each line
is `HH:mm:ss I|E <text>`), and (c) the work item / PR id involved. Every
"Expect:" below quotes real strings from the code at the commit under test —
if the wording differs materially, that is itself a finding.

> Scope note: the README's "Known limitations (v1)" section is partly stale.
> Editor suspend/resume, intra-line word highlighting, syntax highlighting,
> and rename-aware diffs **have since been implemented** (ADR 0009, ADR 0010,
> commits `ceba2f9`, `c77ccaf`). Trust this document and the ADRs, not the
> README, for what to expect.

## 2. Environment capture

Fill in before starting:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Date / tester | |
| OS + version | |
| Terminal emulator | |
| Terminal multiplexer? (zellij/tmux auto-detect `dotnet`; others need `COBALT_DRIVER=dotnet`) | |
| `$TERM` | |
| Truecolor terminal? (`$COLORTERM`) | |
| .NET SDK version (`dotnet --version`, needs 10.0.100+) | |
| `$EDITOR` / `$VISUAL` | |
| ADO organization URL | |
| ADO project | |
| Auth method used (az CLI reuse / `cobalt auth login` browser) | |
| az CLI tenant same as ADO org tenant? | |
| cobalt version (`cobalt --version`) / commit | 0.1.0 / `0e103df` |

## 3. Prerequisites & test fixtures to create in ADO

Set these up in your org/project before starting so every path is reachable.
The "Used by" column names the checklist items that need each fixture.

| # | Fixture | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| FX1 | At least one work item **assigned to you** in a non-terminal state (not Closed/Done/Removed/Completed) — the WIQL query filters on `@Me` and excludes exactly those four states | E1–E4, D10–D12 |
| FX2 | A work item you can safely **transition state** on (and transition back) | E6 |
| FX3 | A work item with a **rich-HTML description** — e.g. paste a table from the web editor, or use inline colors/styles (a `<table>` or `style=` attribute triggers the flag) | E5b |
| FX4 | A work item with a **plain-text / simple description** (paragraphs, bold, lists only) | E5a |
| FX5 | A work item with **tags, priority, and story points** set (display check) | E4 |
| FX6 | A PR where **you are a reviewer and have not voted** (review queue tab) | G2, G8 |
| FX7 | A PR **you authored** (mine tab) | G3 |
| FX8 | Any **active PR** in the project (active tab) — ideally ≥1 draft PR too | G4 |
| FX9 | A **sacrificial PR safe to complete** (with pass-able policies) and one **safe to abandon** | G13, G14 |
| FX10 | A PR whose latest iteration contains: (a) an **edited code file** in C#, JS/TS, JSON, or Python (for syntax colors); (b) a **rename-with-edit** (git `mv` + change a line, commit, push); (c) if possible a **binary file** (e.g. a .png) and/or a **>50,000-line file**; (d) a file containing **CJK or emoji characters** on changed lines (to observe the documented wide-char limitation, NOT to log as a bug) | H1–H12 |
| FX11 | A PR with an **existing comment thread** (create one from the web UI if needed) — note its thread id | G10–G12, H9 |
| FX12 | A PR with **linked work items** (link FX1 to FX7 or FX8) | G7 |
| FX13 | A **second context** in your config — a second project (or org) you have access to; a config with a deliberately **unreachable org** for the broken-auth-status test | B, C4, D9 |

Also required on the machine: the `az` CLI (for the reuse path), a browser
(for interactive sign-in and `gx`), and a real full-screen `$EDITOR`
(`nvim`/`vim`/`nano`) on `$PATH`.

## 4. Setup steps

1. **Install .NET 10 SDK** (the repo pins `10.0.100`, rollForward
   latestFeature). Verify: `dotnet --version`.
2. **Install cobalt** (command name is `cobalt`, package id `cobalt-tui`):
   ```sh
   # from the latest GitHub release (the package is not on nuget.org yet):
   gh release download --repo jinyeow/cobalt --pattern '*.nupkg' --dir .
   dotnet tool install -g cobalt-tui --add-source .
   # or from a local pack (`dotnet pack -o nupkg` first):
   dotnet tool install -g cobalt-tui --add-source ./nupkg
   ```
   Alternatively run from source: `dotnet run --project src/Cobalt -- --help`.
3. **Create the config** at `~/.config/cobalt/config.toml`
   (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cobalt/config.toml` if set; `%APPDATA%\cobalt\config.toml`
   on Windows) with **two contexts** (FX13):
   ```toml
   default_context = "work"

   [contexts.work]
   organization = "https://dev.azure.com/YOUR_ORG"   # or a bare "YOUR_ORG"
   project = "YOUR_PROJECT"

   [contexts.alt]
   organization = "https://dev.azure.com/YOUR_ORG"
   project = "YOUR_OTHER_PROJECT"
   ```
4. **Sign in — two paths, test both** (section C):
   - az CLI reuse: `az login` (same tenant as the ADO org), then no cobalt
     login step is needed at all.
   - Browser: `cobalt auth login` (prints `Opening a browser for Entra ID
     sign-in…`, persists an auth record to
     `~/.config/cobalt/auth-record.json`).
5. **Verify**: `cobalt auth status`, then launch with `cobalt`.
6. Ensure `$EDITOR` (or `$VISUAL`, which wins) points at your editor,
   e.g. `export EDITOR=nvim`. If both are unset, cobalt falls back to `vi`.

---

## 5. Checklist

Record each as: `Result: Pass / Fail — notes:`

### A. CLI basics & exit codes

Check exit codes with `echo $?` immediately after each command.

- [ ] **A1 — version.** Run `cobalt --version` (and `cobalt -v`).
  Expect: the version *with* its 7-char source revision — `0.3.2+<sha>` from a tagged-release
  install, `0.3.2-alpha+<sha>` from any local or branch build — and exit `0`.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **A2 — help.** Run `cobalt --help` (and `-h`).
  Expect: usage block starting `cobalt — a vim-flavored terminal UI for Azure
  DevOps` listing `cobalt [--context <name>]`, `cobalt auth login`,
  `cobalt auth status`, `--version`, `--help`. Exit `0`.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **A3 — unknown argument.** Run `cobalt --bogus`.
  Expect: stderr `cobalt: unknown argument '--bogus' (try --help)`, exit `2`.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **A4 — `--context` without a value.** Run `cobalt --context`.
  Expect: stderr `cobalt: --context requires a value (a context name from your
  config).`, exit `2`. Also try `cobalt --context --context` (value starting
  with `-` is rejected the same way).
  Result: ______
- [ ] **A5 — `--context` twice.** Run `cobalt --context work --context alt`.
  Expect: stderr `cobalt: --context was given more than once.`, exit `2`.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **A6 — bad auth verb.** Run `cobalt auth` and `cobalt auth frobnicate`.
  Expect: stderr `cobalt: usage: cobalt auth <login|status>`, exit `2`.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **A7 — unknown context name.** Run `cobalt --context nope`.
  Expect: fails fast **before** the TUI starts: stderr
  `cobalt: context 'nope' not found; available: alt, work` (names sorted),
  exit `2`.
  Result: ______

### B. Config validation

For each case, temporarily replace `config.toml`, run `cobalt`, check stderr
and exit code `2`, then restore. (Keep a backup copy.)

- [ ] **B1 — missing file.** Move the config aside; run `cobalt`.
  Expect: `cobalt: no config file at <full path>` followed by a template
  (`create one like:` … `default_context = "work"` …). Exit `2`.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **B2 — invalid TOML.** Put `default_context = ` (no value) in the file.
  Expect: `cobalt: config is not valid TOML: <Tomlyn parser message>`.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **B3 — empty file / no contexts.** (a) Empty file → `cobalt: config file
  is empty`. (b) Only `default_context = "work"` → `cobalt: config defines no
  [contexts.*] sections`.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **B4 — missing keys.** A context without `organization` →
  `cobalt: [contexts.work] is missing 'organization'`; without `project` →
  `… is missing 'project'`.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **B5 — partial-URL org.** `organization = "myorg/proj"` →
  `cobalt: [contexts.work] organization 'myorg/proj' looks like a partial URL;
  use either a bare org name or a full https:// URL`.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **B6 — non-https org.** `organization = "http://dev.azure.com/x"` →
  `cobalt: [contexts.work] organization must be an https URL or a bare org
  name, got 'http://dev.azure.com/x'`.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **B7 — unknown default_context.** `default_context = "ghost"` with no
  `[contexts.ghost]` → `cobalt: default_context 'ghost' has no matching
  [contexts.ghost] section`.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **B8 — multiple contexts, no default.** Remove `default_context` (keep 2
  contexts); run `cobalt` with no flag →
  `cobalt: multiple contexts defined but no default_context set; pick one of:
  alt, work`. Then confirm `cobalt --context work` still launches.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **B9 — bare org name.** `organization = "YOUR_ORG"` (no URL).
  Expect: works identically to the full URL (normalized to
  `https://dev.azure.com/YOUR_ORG`) — `cobalt auth status` shows the full URL.
  Result: ______

### C. Auth

- [ ] **C1 — az CLI reuse.** With a valid `az login` session in the org's
  tenant and **no** `auth-record.json` / prior cobalt login, run
  `cobalt auth status`.
  Expect: **no browser opens**; each org line lists its contexts as
  `* work         https://dev.azure.com/ORG [Project]` (`*` marks the default
  context, others get a space) followed by an indented
  `    signed in as <Display Name> (<guid>)`. Exit `0`.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **C2 — interactive browser login.** `az logout` (or use a machine
  without az), then run `cobalt auth login`.
  Expect: prints `Opening a browser for Entra ID sign-in…`, a browser
  sign-in completes, then `Signed in as <username>.` followed by the same
  status listing as C1. Verify `~/.config/cobalt/auth-record.json` now exists
  with `-rw-------` permissions (non-Windows).
  Result: ______
- [ ] **C3 — silent reuse after login.** Run `cobalt auth status` again after
  C2. Expect: no browser (the persisted MSAL cache + auth record make it
  silent), same signed-in output, exit `0`.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **C4 — deliberately-broken context.** Add a context pointing at an org
  you cannot access (e.g. `organization = "somebodyelsesorg"`), run
  `cobalt auth status`.
  Expect: the good org still reports `signed in as …`; the bad org's line
  reports `    NOT signed in — <first line of the error>` (no stack trace),
  and the exit code is `1`. Contexts sharing one org are grouped — identity is
  asked once per org.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **C5 — not signed in at all.** `az logout` and delete
  `~/.config/cobalt/auth-record.json`, then `cobalt auth status`.
  Expect: `NOT signed in — …` for every org, exit `1`, and **no browser is
  opened** (the TUI/status paths never prompt; only `auth login` may).
  Result: ______
- [ ] **C6 — TUI without sign-in.** Still signed out, run `cobalt`.
  Expect: the TUI launches (startup never blocks on auth); the work-item list
  header shows ` error: <message>` and the message bar shows
  `not signed in — <reason> (run: cobalt auth login)`. No crash, no stack
  trace. Quit with `:q`.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **C7 — wrong-tenant token (if reproducible).** If your az CLI is logged
  into a different tenant than the org, ADO answers 203 with a sign-in page;
  cobalt converts that to
  `Azure DevOps did not accept the access token (are you signed in to the
  right tenant?)`. Expect that text in `auth status` / list errors — then
  `az login --tenant <correct>` fixes it. (Skip if not applicable.)
  Result: ______

### D. Shell & vim layer

Sign in properly, run `cobalt`. The shell is: tab strip (top), content,
status line (` ctx:work  <Your Name>` once identity resolves), message bar
(bottom).

- [ ] **D1 — startup.** Expect: work-items section active — tab strip reads
  ` [1:Work Items]  2:Pull Requests `; shortly after, the message bar shows
  `signed in as <Display Name>` and the status line gains your name.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **D2 — section keys.** Press `2` → tab strip flips to
  ` 1:Work Items  [2:Pull Requests]` and the PR list loads. Press `1` → back
  to work items.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **D3 — Tab semantics.** `Tab` depends on whether the preview pane is
  showing (ADR 0024), so verify **both** states.
  *Preview visible* (terminal ≥ 100 cols, `preview = auto`): in either section
  `Tab` cycles focus between the list and the preview pane — it does **not**
  change section or PR sub-tab. `[`/`]` cycle the PR sub-tabs; `gt`/`gT` and
  `1`/`2` change section.
  *Preview hidden* (narrow the terminal below 100 cols, or `:preview off`):
  `Tab` falls back to today's behaviour — in the work-items section it switches
  to the PR section; in the **PR section** `Tab`/`Shift-Tab` do NOT return to
  work items, they cycle the PR sub-tabs (review queue → mine → active), and
  only `1` returns.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **D4 — list movement.** In the work-item list: `j`/`k` move the
  selection down/up; arrow keys also move; `gg` jumps to top, `G` to bottom;
  `Ctrl-d`/`Ctrl-u` half-page.
  *Tester note:* `j/k/gg/G/Ctrl-d/Ctrl-u` are advertised in the README and the
  `?` overlay, but `CobaltShell.Dispatch` has no movement cases and the main
  list views (unlike the diff dialog) don't null the ListView's type-ahead
  navigator — watch closely whether the vim movement keys actually move the
  selection or are swallowed. Record exactly which keys work; failures here
  are real findings.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **D5 — filter.** In the work-item list press `/` → a `/`-prefixed input
  appears on the bottom line; typing filters rows live by title, state, type,
  or id (case-insensitive); `Enter` or `Esc` closes the input keeping/clearing
  focus to the list. Clear the filter text to restore all rows.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **D6 — palette basics.** Press `:` → a `:` prompt replaces the message
  bar. `Esc` cancels. `:` then `garbage` + Enter → message bar shows
  `unknown command: garbage`. Empty input + Enter → nothing.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **D7 — `:help` and `?`.** Both open a modal titled `keys — q to close`
  listing bindings with descriptions (e.g. `j        move down`,
  `:        command palette (:q quit, :ctx NAME)`); aliases collapse (Enter/o
  shows once). `q`, `Esc`, or `Enter` closes it.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **D8 — `:messages`.** Open the palette, type `messages`, Enter.
  Expect: modal titled `messages — q to close` with one line per event:
  `HH:mm:ss I signed in as …` / `HH:mm:ss E …` (I=info, E=error), capped at
  200 entries.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **D9 — context switching.** `:ctx` (no arg) → message bar
  `contexts: alt, work — switch with :ctx NAME`. `:ctx nope` →
  `unknown context 'nope' (available: alt, work)`. `:ctx alt` → status line
  changes to ` ctx:alt` and message `switched to context 'alt'`.
  **Known v1 gap (do not log as a bug):** the in-app switch updates the
  chrome only — the data connection is *not* rebuilt (see the
  `Real reconnection lands with the data screens (M3)` comment in
  `CobaltShell`), so lists keep showing the launch context's data. Verify
  instead that `cobalt --context alt` from the CLI shows the other project's
  items for real.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **D10 — refresh.** Change a work item's title in the ADO web UI, press
  `r` in the list. Expect: header flashes ` loading work items…` then the row
  updates.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **D11 — `yy` yank.** Select a work item, press `y` `y`.
  Expect: `yanked https://dev.azure.com/ORG/PROJECT/_workitems/edit/<id>` and
  the URL is on the system clipboard; on a clipboard-less terminal instead
  `clipboard unavailable — <url>` (the URL is still shown — that's the
  fallback). In the PR section the URL shape is
  `…/PROJECT/_git/<repo>/pullrequest/<id>`.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **D12 — `gx` open in browser.** Select an item, press `g` `x`.
  Expect: default browser opens that URL; message `opened <url>`. On failure:
  `could not open browser: <error>`.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **D13 — empty-selection yank/open.** With an empty list (e.g. filter to
  nothing is not enough — needs no rows; use a context with no items or the
  error state), `yy` → `nothing to yank — select a work item or PR first`,
  `gx` → `nothing to open — select a work item or PR first`.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **D14 — `q` at top level.** Press `q` in the main shell.
  Expect: does NOT quit; message `nothing to close — quit with :q`. Then `:q`
  (or `:quit`) actually exits with code `0` and your shell prompt/terminal
  state is restored cleanly.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **D15 — pending-key handling.** Press `g` then `Esc` then `j`.
  Expect: `Esc` clears the pending `g` (no `gg` fires) and `j` moves normally.
  Also `g` followed by an unbound key (e.g. `z`) just resets — no crash.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **D16 — the preview follows the cursor (two tiers, ADR 0024).** On a
  terminal ≥ 100 cols with `preview = auto`, in either section: the preview
  shows the highlighted row **instantly** on every `j`/`k` — no blank pane and
  no `loading…` flash while moving. Stop on a row: within ~200 ms the pane
  fills out with the fetched detail (a PR gains its policies and thread list;
  a work item gains its description and comments). Now hold `j` down through
  20+ rows: the pane must keep up with the cursor, and when you stop it must
  settle on the row you stopped on — never on one you passed through. The
  headless suite proves the invariant; what you are judging here is feel and
  staleness.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **D17 — preview scrolling with real content.** Select an item with a long
  description, `Tab` to the preview, and scroll with `j`/`k`/`C-d`/`C-u`/`gg`/
  `G`. Expect the text to scroll and the scrollbar to track it. Watch the
  **rightmost column**: the vertical scrollbar must not sit on top of text, and
  no horizontal scrollbar should appear along the bottom (preview text is
  clamped to the pane width minus the scrollbar column). Either one is a
  finding — a headless test cannot see the drawn scrollbars.
  Result: ______

### E. Work items

- [ ] **E1 — list contents (FX1).** Section 1 header:
  ` my work items (<count>)`. Rows show columns in order: right-aligned 6-char
  id, type (8), state (10), title (40), last segment of the iteration path
  (14), changed date `yyyy-MM-dd`. Long values truncate with a trailing `…`.
  Cross-check the count and ordering (most recently changed first) against an
  ADO query `Assigned To = @Me AND State NOT IN (Closed, Done, Removed,
  Completed)`.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **E2 — terminal states excluded.** Close/complete one of your items in
  the web UI, press `r`. Expect: it disappears from the list. (Note: only the
  four states `Closed`, `Done`, `Removed`, `Completed` are excluded — a
  process with other terminal-state names, e.g. `Resolved`, will still show;
  that's per the WIQL in `WorkItemsApi`, not a bug.)
  Result: ______
- [ ] **E3 — open detail.** `Enter` (or `o`) on an item. Expect a modal titled
  `work item #<id> — q close · s state · c comment · e edit · a assign · t
  tags` showing `<Type> #<id>   [<State>]`, `Title:`, `Assigned:`
  (`(unassigned)` when empty), `Iteration:`, `Tags:`, `Priority: <n or ->   Points: <n or ->`,
  a `── Description ──` section, and `── Comments (N) ──` with
  `  <author> (yyyy-MM-dd): <text>` lines. `q`/`Esc` closes.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **E4 — field display (FX5).** Open the item with tags/priority/points.
  Expect tags comma-joined, priority and points shown as numbers.
  **Known v1 gap:** priority, story points, and title have no edit keybinding
  in the detail dialog (the view-model supports them; the UI wires only
  s/c/e/a/t) — display-only is expected.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **E5 — description rendering.**
  (a) FX4 plain item: description renders as readable Markdown (headings,
  bold, lists), header exactly `── Description ──`; an empty description shows
  `(empty)`.
  (b) FX3 rich-HTML item: header carries the lossiness warning:
  `── Description ──  ⚠ rich HTML: editing may drop formatting`.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **E6 — state transition (FX2).** Press `s`.
  Expect: a `change state` dialog whose buttons are the **process-template
  states for that work-item type** (from `workitemtypes/{type}/states` — e.g.
  New/Active/Resolved/Closed for Agile Bug), not a hardcoded list. Pick one →
  message bar `state → <State>`, the `[State]` in the detail header updates,
  and after closing the list reflects it. Verify in the web UI. Transition
  back. An invalid transition (if your process restricts any) must surface
  `failed: <ADO message>`, not crash.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **E7 — assign.** Press `a`.
  Expect: your `$EDITOR` opens on a temp `.txt` file (empty) — type a user's
  **unique name (email UPN)**, save, quit. Message bar shows the prompt title
  `assign to (unique name)` on success (yes, the success message is the prompt
  text) or `failed: <ADO message>` (e.g. for an unknown identity —
  TF-something). `Assigned:` updates. Reassign to yourself afterwards.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **E8 — tags.** Press `t`.
  Expect: `$EDITOR` opens pre-filled with the current tags joined `; `.
  Edit (semicolon-separated), save, quit → success message
  `tags (semicolon separated)`; the `Tags:` line and the web UI update.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **E9 — comment round-trip.** Press `c`.
  Expect: `$EDITOR` on an empty `.md` file. Write Markdown (e.g.
  `**bold** and a list`), save, quit → `comment added`, the comment appears at
  once in `── Comments (N) ──` (count +1) with you as author. Check the web
  UI renders it as formatted HTML (cobalt converts Markdown→HTML on save and
  HTML→Markdown on read).
  Result: ______
- [ ] **E10 — edit description in `$EDITOR` (suspend/resume).** Press `e` on
  FX4. Expect: **the TUI fully hands over the terminal** — nvim/vim takes the
  whole screen with the description as Markdown; while inside the editor,
  keys (including `q`) go to the editor only. `:wq` → the TUI redraws cleanly
  (no torn frames, no leftover editor rows), message `description saved`, and
  the new text shows in the detail and the web UI.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **E11 — lossiness warning honored (FX3).** Open the rich-HTML item,
  confirm the `⚠ rich HTML: editing may drop formatting` flag from E5b, press
  `e`, make a trivial edit, save. Expect `description saved` — then verify in
  the web UI what formatting was dropped (tables/styles degrade; this
  *degradation* is the documented lossy behavior, not a bug — the warning
  before editing is the contract).
  Result: ______
- [ ] **E12 — editor cancel paths.** Press `e`, then (a) quit without changes
  (`:q`) — expect **no** save, no message; (b) quit with a non-zero exit
  (`:cq` in vim) after editing — expect the edit is **discarded** (non-zero
  exit ⇒ discard). Same contract for `c`/`a`/`t`.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **E13 — list refresh after detail.** Close the detail after E6/E8.
  Expect the list reloads automatically (edits visible without pressing `r`).
  Result: ______
- [ ] **E14 — detail error surface.** Force an error (e.g. sign out az
  mid-session, or open a deleted work item id — do E14 last): detail body
  shows `error: <message>` (or the list shows ` error: …`); never a stack
  trace.
  Result: ______

### F. Editor round-trip specifics

- [ ] **F1 — `$VISUAL` precedence.** Set `VISUAL=nvim` and `EDITOR=nano`;
  press `c` on a work item. Expect nvim (VISUAL wins). Unset `VISUAL` →
  `EDITOR` is used. Unset both → `vi`.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **F2 — editor with arguments.** `export EDITOR="code --wait"` (or any
  command with args/quotes). Expect the argument split honors quotes and the
  round-trip still works.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **F3 — missing editor surfaces cleanly.** `export EDITOR=doesnotexist`,
  press `c`. Expect the app stays alive and the message bar shows
  `editor failed: could not start editor 'doesnotexist' — check
  $VISUAL/$EDITOR`.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **F4 — editor from PR context.** Repeat a round-trip from PR detail
  (`c` reply, G10) and from diff review (`c`, H8). Expect identical
  suspend/resume behavior and the same `editor failed: …` on failure.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **F5 — stray keys during editing.** While the editor is open, type `q`,
  `:`, `1`, `2` as text. Expect none of them leak to the TUI (the input loop
  is parked); on exit the shell is exactly where you left it.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **F6 — temp file hygiene.** After a few edits, check `$TMPDIR`/`/tmp`
  for leftover `cobalt-<guid>.md|.txt` files. Expect none (best-effort
  delete).
  Result: ______

### G. Pull requests

- [ ] **G1 — three tabs.** Press `2`. Header cycles with `[`/`]` through
  ` pull requests · review queue (N)   [Tab] switch` → ` … · mine (N) …` →
  ` … · active (N) …` and back; `[` cycles in reverse. `Tab`/`Shift-Tab` do the
  same **only while the preview pane is hidden** — with the preview showing they
  cycle pane focus instead (D3). While loading:
  ` pull requests · <tab> · loading…`; on failure:
  ` pull requests · <tab> · error: <message>`.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **G2 — review queue = awaiting MY vote (FX6).** The review-queue tab
  must list only active PRs where you are a reviewer **and your vote is
  currently "no vote"** (the pending filter is client-side). Vote on one
  (G8) and refresh (`r`): it must drop out of this tab.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **G3 — mine (FX7).** Lists only active PRs you created.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **G4 — active (FX8).** Lists all active PRs in the project (top 100).
  Row format: `!<id>  <repo(12)>  <votes>  [draft] <title(50)>` where votes
  are `✗ rej` (any reject) / `⧗ wait` (any waiting-for-author) /
  `✓ <n>` (n approvals) / `·` (none), and `[draft]` marks draft PRs.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **G5 — repo filter.** **Known v1 gap (do not log as bug):** the
  repository filter exists only in the view-model (`RepositoryFilter`); no key
  is wired to it — pressing `/` in the PR section does nothing (the shell's
  filter action targets the work-item list only). Verify `/` is a harmless
  no-op here and note the gap in findings.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **G6 — open PR detail.** `Enter`/`o` on a PR. Expect a modal titled
  `PR !<id> — q close · d diff · v vote · c reply · x resolve · u reactivate ·
  C complete · A abandon` with: `!<id>  <title>` (+ `  [draft]`),
  `<repo>: refs/heads/<src> → refs/heads/<tgt>   status: <status>   merge:
  <mergeStatus or ?>`, `author: <name>`, and a `Reviewers:` block with one
  `  <glyph> <name>` per reviewer (`✓` approved, `✓~` w/ suggestions, `⧗`
  waiting, `✗` rejected, `·` no vote) plus ` (required)` where applicable.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **G7 — linked work items + threads (FX12, FX11).** Same dialog:
  `Linked work items: #<id>, …` when present; `── Description ──`; and
  `── Threads (N unresolved) ──` where each thread renders
  `  #<threadId> [Active|Fixed|…] [<file path>:<line>]` (file/line only for
  line-anchored threads) with non-system comments as `      <author>: <text>`.
  N counts **active, non-system** threads. Cross-check N with the web UI.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **G8 — vote: all five values.** Press `v`. Expect a `vote` dialog with
  exactly the buttons `approve`, `approve w/ suggestions`, `wait for author`,
  `reject`, `reset`. Choose `approve` → message `voted: approve` and your
  reviewer glyph becomes `✓` after the auto-reload. Repeat over the five
  values (finish with `reset` → glyph `·`, message `voted: reset`; reset
  returns the vote to "no vote" so the PR re-enters your review queue).
  Result: ______
- [ ] **G9 — vote reflected in list.** Close the detail. Expect the PR list
  reloads automatically and the vote-summary column reflects the change.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **G10 — reply to a thread (FX11).** Note a thread id `#<n>` from the
  detail body. Press `c`. Expect **two** editor round-trips: first a `.txt`
  buffer — type just the thread id (e.g. `42`), save, quit; then a `.md`
  buffer for the reply text. Save both → `reply posted`, the reply appears
  under that thread after reload. (A non-numeric/empty id silently aborts —
  no message; that's the coded behavior.)
  Result: ______
- [ ] **G11 — resolve thread.** Press `x`, enter the thread id in the editor.
  Expect `thread resolved`, the thread's status shows `[Fixed]`, and the
  unresolved count decrements.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **G12 — reactivate thread.** Press `u`, same id. Expect
  `thread reactivated`, status back to `[Active]`, count increments.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **G13 — complete with strategy prompt (FX9, sacrificial).** Press `C`.
  Expect a `complete PR` dialog `merge strategy:` with buttons
  `noFastForward`, `squash`, `rebase`, `rebaseMerge`; picking one raises a
  second confirmation `Complete with <strategy>?` with `cancel`/`complete`.
  Cancel first — nothing happens. Re-run and confirm → `PR completed`; the PR
  merges in the web UI with that strategy. The source branch is **not**
  deleted (`deleteSource: false` is hardcoded). On a policy-blocked PR expect
  `failed: <ADO policy message>` instead.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **G14 — abandon with confirm (FX9).** On the other sacrificial PR press
  `A`. Expect `abandon PR` / `Abandon this pull request?` with
  `cancel`/`abandon`. Cancel → no change. Confirm → `PR abandoned`; verify in
  the web UI (and reactivate it there afterwards if wanted).
  Result: ______
- [ ] **G15 — verbs are detail-only.** In the PR **list**, `v` shows no dialog
  (the list scope binds it but nothing dispatches it) — expect a no-op, not a
  crash. Same for `c`/`s`/`a` in the work-item list. Known v1 shape; note it.
  Result: ______

### H. Diff review (FX10)

Open the FX10 PR's detail and press `d`.

- [ ] **H1 — dialog opens.** Title: `diff review !<id> — q close · Tab
  files/diff · c comment · [ ] next/prev file`. Left ~28%: changed-file list;
  right: header + unified diff of the first file. While loading:
  ` loading diff…`.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **H2 — file list glyphs.** Each file is `<glyph> <path>` with `+` add,
  `-` delete, `»` rename, `~` edit; paths longer than 34 chars shorten to
  `…<last 33 chars>`.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **H3 — diff header + coloring.** Header: ` <path>   +<adds> -<dels>`.
  Body rows: gutter `<●| ><old#,4> <new#,4> <+|-| >` then the line text.
  Added lines carry a full-width dark-green tint (`#123a12`), removed lines
  dark red (`#3a1212`), context lines the normal background; the `+`/`-` sign
  renders bright green/red. On a non-truecolor terminal the tints degrade to
  the nearest palette color but the sign column still distinguishes lines.
  Cross-check `+/-` counts against the web UI's diff (small cosmetic
  differences in hunk shaping are expected — client-side DiffPlex vs. server).
  Result: ______
- [ ] **H4 — intra-line word emphasis.** Find a modified line pair (removed +
  added versions of the same line). Expect only the changed words carry a
  brighter emphasis tint (`#1e6b1e` on added / `#6b2020` on removed) while
  the unchanged words keep the plain line tint. A **totally rewritten** line
  (>60% changed on either side) intentionally shows NO word emphasis — plain
  add/remove, not confetti.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **H5 — syntax highlighting.** On a `.cs` (or `.js/.jsx/.ts/.tsx/.mjs/
  .cjs/.json/.py`) file: keywords, identifiers, strings, numbers, comments,
  operators render in distinct theme colors (e.g. keyword `var` vs identifier
  differ). Any other extension (e.g. `.md`, `.txt`) falls back to plain — one
  foreground, still diff-tinted.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **H6 — rename-aware diff.** Select the rename-with-edit file (`»`
  glyph). Expect a real diff of old-path→new-path content: header shows e.g.
  `+1 -1` for a one-line edit — **not** a whole-file `+N -0` add.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **H7 — navigation.** `]`/`[` select next/previous file (clamped at the
  ends — no wrap, no crash); `j`/`k` move within the focused pane; `Tab`
  toggles focus between file list and diff pane; `Enter` on the file list
  opens the highlighted file. Reviewing position: after adding a comment to
  the same file the selected line is preserved; switching files resets to the
  top.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **H8 — line comment, right side.** Move the diff cursor onto an
  **added** line, press `c`, write a comment in the editor, save.
  Expect `line comment added` and a `●` appears in that row's gutter. In the
  **web UI**, the thread must anchor to exactly that line on the **new/right**
  side of the file. Repeat on a **context** line (also right side).
  Result: ______
- [ ] **H9 — line comment, left side.** Repeat on a **removed** line.
  Expect the web UI anchors it to the old/**left** side at the old line
  number. Existing threads (FX11 + the ones just created) show `●` markers on
  their lines; the new threads also appear in PR detail (G7) with
  `[<path>:<line>]`.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **H10 — comment failure surface.** (Optional) Force a failure (e.g.
  drop network before saving). Expect `comment failed: <message>`.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **H11 — binary / large-file guards.** Select the binary file. Expect an
  empty diff pane and header ` <path>   +0 -0  (binary)` (NUL-byte
  heuristic). A >50,000-line file shows `  (too large)`. `c` on an empty
  guarded diff does nothing (no editor opens).
  Result: ______
- [ ] **H12 — no-iterations edge.** (Optional, if you can produce a PR with
  no iterations) Expect header ` error: this pull request has no iterations
  to diff`.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **H13 — CJK/emoji observation (NOT a bug).** Select the file with CJK/
  emoji on changed lines. Expected *documented* imperfections (ADR 0010): the
  full-width tint may stop short of the right edge on wide-char lines and
  horizontal scroll bounds may be slightly off; a word boundary through an
  emoji may render `U+FFFD`. Verify only that there is **no crash, no torn
  rows, no misordered text** — anything beyond the cosmetic issues above IS a
  bug.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **H14 — close.** `q`/`Esc` closes the diff dialog back to PR detail;
  `q` again to the list. No residual artifacts.
  Result: ______

### I. Robustness

- [ ] **I1 — human-readable errors everywhere.** Across all failures seen so
  far: every error is one readable line (ADO's own `message` field where
  available, else `Azure DevOps returned <code> <reason>`); never a stack
  trace, never a raw JSON dump — on screen or in `:messages`.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **I2 — network drop.** Disconnect networking, press `r` in each list.
  Expect ` error: <HttpRequestException message>` in the header /
  `failed: …` in dialogs; the app stays responsive; reconnect + `r` recovers.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **I3 — permission denied.** Attempt a mutation you lack rights for
  (e.g. vote/complete in a project where you're a Reader). Expect
  `failed: <ADO authorization message>`; no crash.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **I4 — quitting from every screen.** Verify a clean path out from: main
  list (`:q`), work-item detail (`q`), PR detail (`q`), diff review (`q`),
  help/messages dialogs (`q`), palette (`Esc`), filter (`Esc`), and while a
  list is still loading. Terminal state must be restored after exit (echo,
  cursor, no alternate-screen residue).
  Result: ______
- [ ] **I5 — resize.** Resize the terminal (narrow, wide, very short) with
  the list, a detail dialog, and the diff review open. Expect relayout
  without crash or duplicated chrome; long rows clip rather than wrap.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **I6 — double `--context` fast-fail vs. TUI.** `cobalt --context alt`
  with the alt context valid: TUI starts directly in `ctx:alt` (status line)
  and lists that project's data.
  Result: ______
- [ ] **I7 — rapid input.** Mash `j`/`k`/`Tab`/`1`/`2`/`r` quickly, switch
  sections during a load. Expect no crash and no stuck "loading…" (a canceled
  load on section switch is expected and silent).
  Result: ______

---

## 6. Known limitations — do NOT log these as bugs

From the ADRs and CHANGELOG (plus code-verified v1 gaps). Observe and move on;
only regressions *beyond* these descriptions are findings.

1. **Wide characters (CJK, emoji) in diffs** — the diff-state tint can stop
   short of the row edge and horizontal scroll bounds are slightly off on
   lines with double-width runes; cosmetic only, no crash (ADR 0010).
2. **Surrogate pairs** — a word-diff/token boundary can split an emoji and
   render `U+FFFD` on that slice (ADR 0010).
3. **Line-local syntax highlighting** — the interior of `/* … */` block
   comments and multi-line/triple-quoted/verbatim strings tokenizes per line
   as code (ADR 0010).
4. **Line comments anchor to the latest PR iteration only**; the diff is
   computed client-side and may differ cosmetically from the server's
   (rename/whitespace hunk heuristics) (ADR 0008). Cross-iteration thread
   tracking is post-v1.
5. **Keybindings are fixed in v1** — no remapping config.
6. **`$EDITOR` needs a real interactive terminal** — headless/pipe sessions
   can't do the suspend/resume hand-off (ADR 0009). Cancellation is not
   observed while the editor runs; it always runs to completion.
7. **az-login tenant must match the ADO org's tenant** — otherwise ADO
   answers 203 and cobalt reports the "right tenant?" message (ADR 0003).
   Conditional-access tenants may block the browser flow; use the az path.
8. **`:ctx NAME` switches chrome only** — the live connection is not rebuilt
   in v1 (`CobaltShell` M3 comment); use `cobalt --context NAME`.
9. **PR repository filter is not wired to a key** — `/` does nothing in the
   PR section (view-model only).
10. **Work-item title/priority/story-points have no edit keybinding** in the
    detail dialog (display only); complete never deletes the source branch.
11. **WIQL terminal-state list is fixed** to Closed/Done/Removed/Completed —
    custom processes with other closed-state names will still list those
    items.
12. **HTML→Markdown is lossy on rich HTML** (tables, inline styles) — the
    `⚠ rich HTML` warning is the contract; degradation after an `e` edit on
    such items is expected.

## 7. Results summary & sign-off

| Section | Items | Pass | Fail | Skipped |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A. CLI basics | 7 | | | |
| B. Config | 9 | | | |
| C. Auth | 7 | | | |
| D. Shell & vim | 15 | | | |
| E. Work items | 14 | | | |
| F. Editor round-trip | 6 | | | |
| G. Pull requests | 15 | | | |
| H. Diff review | 14 | | | |
| I. Robustness | 7 | | | |
| **Total** | **94** | | | |

**Blocking issues found** (id, one line each):

-
-

**Non-blocking findings / gaps confirmed** (e.g. D4 movement keys, G5 repo
filter, D9 ctx switch):

-
-

**If it breaks, capture this** for each failure: the checklist id; exact
reproduction steps (keys pressed, in order); the on-screen text (message bar
and any dialog, verbatim); the full `:messages` history (or stderr + exit code
for CLI items); the work item / PR / thread id and repository; terminal
emulator + `$TERM` + window size; and whether it reproduces after `r` or a
restart.

Sign-off: I certify the checklist above was executed against a real Azure
DevOps organization and the results recorded truthfully.
